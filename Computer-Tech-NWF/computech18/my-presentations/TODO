ALL SESSIONS
============

screen shots for opening slides:
    scientific software:
        pic of Einstein

    toolbox:
        montage of olders tools (slide rule --> computer)

    resume:
        github or a resume (see Monster.com) or an intern
        video clip of the millenial interview

screen shots for ending slides:
    repeat??

opening question to go with opening slide:
    scientific software:
        recognize this man?
        you or your family members want a similar career?
        listen up

    toolbox:
        montage of older tools (slide rule / desk calculater --> computer)
        engineering students have much more powerful tools today than
            when i went to school
        and linux offers so much more than Windows

    resume:
        do you know anyone needing to beef up a resume?
        it's hard to get an internship, but there is an
            alternative if that's not in the cards (and
            it can be a supplement)

emphasize students are getting heavy training in Windows
    and may know nothing about other operating
    systems such as (list)

    if they go into any kind of technical discipline they
    most likely will profit from at least a familiarity
    with one or more of them

try using a p6 file and Cairo to generate eps files with text to
  be included on a slide!
  + look at Text::More

screen shots
put perl books in classroom
put operating hardware in classroom

STEMM - science, technology, engineering, mathematics, medicine
STEAM - science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics
        (art including music)

target audience: adults who know
  children interested in STEMM, music,
  arts, or who are also interested
  in such things

take my linux small laptop
Linux posters...

========================

likely target: parents of STEMM, music, art, children

NWFLUG - monthly, website, linux (software and hardware)

Niceville PM - all things Perl 6/5

1-free-science-progs
========================

+ show my thesis
+ jupyter
+ scripting languages
+ graphic design
+ publishing cycle:
  latex
  inkscape
  postscript
+ R
+ scilab
+ brlcad
+ chemical progs
+ fea

+ photo progs

2-linux-slide-rule
========================

+ distros, pic of destop with shell terminals
+ CLI programs
+ brlcad, etc.
+ scripting languages
+ one-off projects need flexibility
+ example of my thesis: code writing code
+ example of HPC use
+ example of brlcad use

example process from my experience as a project manager of a DOD
contractor:

+ contract requirements: given a list of one or more real-world mobile
  offensive or defensive weapon systems, assess their vulnerability to:

  the following threats 1..N (16 or more)
  for the following views... (45 or more)
  for the following impact conditions... (10 or more)
  for the following kill levels (3 or more)
  ...

processing steps are often iterative in that one step may show a need
to modify a previous step

difficult to modify a window program, usually requires a manual step
