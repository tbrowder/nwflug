## Linux: What is it?

GNU/Linux is a general name for an operating system (*OS*, sometime
written as O/S) with a Linux kernel plus a suite of GNU (Free Software
Foundation) software tools that, together, provide nearly the
equivalent of a POSIX-certified OS like UNIX, HPUX, or IRIX.

GNU/Linux OS's come in many complete formes, callled *distributions*
(or *distros*).  One of the most well-known distros is Ubuntu, which,
up until very recently, was used by Google, but they just announced
they were moving to *Debian*, my distro of choice for over 10 years.

Note that Microsoft now provides a version of Ubuntu as an add-on to
Windows 10.

## Linux: Why should I care?

Linux drives a significant part of the Internet and the cloud.

## Linux: How do I get it?

You can get Ubuntu now with Windows 10 and that is probably the
easiest way to get familiar with it, but you'll eventually want a
native installation for more general-purpose use.

## Linux: How do I learn to use it?

A free online course is offered under the auspices of the Linux Foundation

My group, the NWFLUG, can provide assistance with installation and use.
