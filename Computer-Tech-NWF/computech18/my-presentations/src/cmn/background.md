## Background

- Retired USAF fighter pilot, retired engineer with ManTech Corporation

- Programmed computers since 1961, had my own programmable computer(s) since 1974

- Used Unix and GNU/Linux and FOSS professionally for over 23 years

    - Use them daily in my personal projects as well as my work on FOSS projects

- I'm curious about lots of things, I'm passionate about computer programming

## My View as a Knowledge Worker

- **It's more fun to produce digital products than use them.**

- **The PC is a producer's tool box.**

- **The iPad is for?**

- **All tasks can be seen as filtering and transforming data (in binary or text format).**

- **All tasks should be automated as much as possible.**

## My View as a Knowledge Worker

- **Interoperability between tools relies on knowing data formats for inputs and outputs.**

- **FOSS allows access to internals while proprietary tools usually don't.**

- **Proprietary tools tend to be more expensive as they become more complex and more useful.**

- **The public education system is Windows-centric to the detriment of some children.**
