## Engineer's Tools

In my college days (early 1960's) we used:

- slide rule
- programmable calculator
- mathematical tables (CRC Tables)
- desk calculator
- *mainframe digital computer
- *analog computer

\* shared use

## Engineer's Tools

Current day engineers use

- personal computer
- *cloud computers

\* shared use

## Why Linux?

- Tool box atmosphere

- CLI more usable

- Multidisciplinary

- Kit bashing

- More control over your system

## Windows vs. Linux

- Windows:

	- Is everywhere

	- It's primarily a GUI operation

	- Expensive

	- **Hides internals**

    - **Non-case-sensitive file system**

- Linux:

	- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

	- Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
	  "programmable calculator"

	- **Is free**

    - **Ugrades are done ONLY if you want to!**

Note that in Linux we say *directories*, **not** *folders*!

## Kitbashing

The Urban Disctionary define *kitbashing* as *The practice of
modifying a model (not limited to toy action figures) to achieve some
result other than that intended by the manufacturer.*

I use it similarly in that, given a particular task and resulting work
flow, a person may have to use a model (program) that is reswtricted
in some way, and envelope it to get the desired results.

## Kitbashing Example**

Some commercial programs I've seen require you to take the following steps:

- tediously hand-enter data for individual *cases*

- run the \*program which outputs results in some rigid text format (may be difficult to *parse*)

- post-process the output into desired form

That manually-intensive work becomes almost impossible if the set of
*cases* gets too large (or at least the time and costs get too
expensive for both parties).

\* The saddest cases are the programs which output data in their own
  proprietary format which only their post-processor can use!  Keep as
  far away as possible!

## Kitbashing Example**

With *Linux* one can usually find a way to automate the task anyway.  One **tool** to help do that
is **Expect** which is not available under Windows unless you use the **Cygwin** or other work-around environments running under Windows.
