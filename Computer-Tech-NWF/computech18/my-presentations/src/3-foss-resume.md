## AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS

**What do you expect from this presentation?**

## OBJECTIVE

My purpose is to give you an introduction to
collaboration with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
as a means of gaining real technical experience.

I hope the parents and grandparents of children
interested in a technical career can benefit from
the information and pass that ocollaboration with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
as a means of gaining real technical experience.

I hope the parents and grandparents of children
interested in a technical career can benefit from
the information and pass that on.

## FOSS: An alternative to internships

Software developers are in demand, as are other technical
positions.

An internship in an appropriate position is an ideal way
to see and be seen working in you desired field.

However, good internships are not easy to come by.

FOSS collaboration can be an alternative, or a supplement, to
an internship.

## FOSS Collaboration

There are many websites where one can find FOSS projects hosted,
but the ones I have used are:

- Github
- Bitbucket
- SourceForge

Github is my favorite, and it is one of the most popular sites.

## FOSS Participation

**Joining**

After finding a project you want to work with, you will have
to join that group's communication channels.
That may be one or more mailing lists, wikis, Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) channels, or forums. Some projects also
use Google Groups.

Some projects have multiple mailing lists with a special one
for newcomers.

**Newcomers**

Project's vary in reputation for friendliness, but don't be
put off if they are too impatient. It's a good idea to lurk
unnoticed for awhile so you can get a feeling for how
they treat *newbies* (aka *noobs*).

**Policies**

A good project will have documented policies and procedures. They may have 
a formal management structure.

**Procedures**

By procedures I mean documented methods for completing such regular tasks as:

- submitting a pull request (PR)

- reviewing and merging PR's

- preparing a release

- publishing a releaee

**Roles**

You may work at many roles on a project:

- project leader(s), release managers

    - usually a meritorious position, gained by experience
      and good work in the trenches

- tecnical writer

    - always needed (programmers are notorious for lack
      of documentation)

- programmer

    - submit code changes


## GITHUB

Github uses the **git** *distributed* version control system.  You
will have to learn how to use it and you can practice
with it on your own system, whether Windows, Mac, or Linux.
See the handout for the Git website where you can git for
your system and help for using git.


Github has a pretty good help section, but 
## MY EXPERIENCES

**While Employed**

While still employed as an engineer, our company had
to regularly submit employee resumes with proposal
packages.  My resume always mentioned expertese with
vulnerability analysis tools, one of which the 
US DoD-supported, FOSS CAD program, BRL-CAD (hosted on SourceForge).
I had significant contributions to that project
that I could reference in my resume and which
could be viewed by anyone interested in confirming
that.

## MY EXPERIENCES

**While "Unemployed"**

Although officially retired, I'm actively supporting
one major FOSS project (**Rakudo Perk 6**), located on Github and consisting of
three major subprojects, each having its own Github project name:

- perl6
- rakudo
- moarvm

My Github user name is **tbrowder** and I have a lot of *repos* there,
including *repo forks*.

## SUMMARY

Github, as well as other such sites, are popular collaboration
platforms for thousands of FOSS projects of all kinds.

By working on one or more FOSS projects with publicly documented 
contributions, you can have a powerful testament to
your technical or managerial skills.
