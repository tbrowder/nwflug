## Geniuses

Characteristics

- Curious?

- Passionate?

- Range of interests?

## Geniuses

You don't have to be a genius to be a scientist, but I believe you do
have to have a curiosity and a passion for technical details in one or
more areas to be successful in STEAM fields.

My objective today is to expose you to some software that may be
useful in one or more of those fields.

- Perhaps you have a child or grandchild who might benefit from the
  information.

The beauty of the software is it is free, runs on a wide variety of
hardware, and thus has a low or no cost for those needing access to
it.

- Perhaps your civic club or church can use it for helping underserved
  children or adults.

## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

Following are some of the programs I have used for professional and
personal projects:

**Graphical**

- **Gimp** (replace **Photoshop** for bitmap images)

- **Inkscape** (replace **CorelDraw** for vector images)

**Office suites**

- **LibreOffice** (replace **MS Office**)

**CAD**

- **BRL-CAD**

**Version control and collaboration**

- **Github**
- **Bitbucket**
- **SourceForge**


## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

Other programs:

**Mathematical programming**

- **SciLab** (replace **MatLab**)

**Publishing (page layout)**

- **Scribus** (replace **MS Publisher** or **Adobe PageMaker/InDesign**)

**Statistical programming**

- **R** (repalce **SAS** or **SPSS**)

## Why do we recommend and use FOSS?

- Source is available for inspection

- Fixes are available from the community of developers

- Two major variants:

	- Free for non-commercial use

	- Free for any use

- Why do developers work on FOSS?

	- Fun, pride, self-interest, altruism, competition

	- Some are paid by companies with a vested interest in a
	  particular FOSS project

- Why do companies give it away?

	- Constrained by licensing

	- Sell support services

- Doesn't it seem like socialism?

## Windows vs. Linux

- Windows:

	- Is everywhere

	- It's primarily a GUI operation

	- Expensive

	- Hides internals

- Linux:

	- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

	- Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
	  programmable calculator

	- Is free

# Fundamentals

- I assume familiarity with getting around your computer and the
  internet and with:

	- Files and directories (folders)

	- Searching (local and web)

	- Downloading and installing

	- Browsing

	- Getting help

	- Command line use

## Internet considerations

- Like the Biblical Tree of Knowledge

	- Good

		- Infinite resources for good

	- Evil

		- Criminals, terrorists, and mischief makers abound

- You **must** be on the alert

## Security concerns

- Browser security

- Download authentication

- Encrypted communications (**https**)

- DNS spoofing

	- **google.com** translates to an IP address by a DNS server

	- DNS servers can be hijacked

	- Familiar home pages can be hijacked

## Browser security

- Chrome (or Firefox)

	- **Lastpass** add-on (**<https://lastpass.com>**)

		- Strong passwords

		- Unique password for every site

- Use **https** where available

	- Provides encrypted communications between you and recipient

## Authentication

- Use check sums to check downloaded files

	- Jacksum

- Use public key encryption when appropriate

	- GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)

## Preparation for using FOSS

- Install a zip program (7Zip)

- Install (if necessary) Windows Power Shell

- Install a check sums program (Jacksum)

- Install a public key program (gpg)

## Tour of free programs and resources

Use my free handout available online at **<https://computertechnwf.org>**.

# Some brief looks

## Inkscape

Replacement for Corel Draw

Here is one of my drawings: a circuit diagram. (**demo**)

The same drawing converted to a bitmap:

## Gimp

Replacement for Photoshop

I use all the time for preparing images for my websites.  I crop all
my images to a small square and then scale to 100x100 pixels to use as
thumb nails.

We look at one of my sites for an example (report 2014-08-23).

<**<https://psrr.info/pauls-reports.html>**>

Here is an example of how I do that. (**demo**)

## GnuCash

Replacement for Quicken

## Libreoffice

Replacement for Microsoft Office

## Summary

- Today we have looked at a few of the thousands of free programs
  available for Windows (and Mac and Linux).

- There is something out there for nearly any interest.  I encourage
  you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your knowledge and skills.
