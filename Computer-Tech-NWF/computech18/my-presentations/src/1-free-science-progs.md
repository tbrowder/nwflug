## AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS

**What do you expect from this presentation?**

## OBJECTIVE

My purpose is to give you an introduction to
available Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
for scientists and other technical persons.

I hope the parents and grandparents of children
interested in a technical career can benefit from
the information and pass that on.

## FOSS

- **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware (FOSS) for Windows, Mac, and Linux

- **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**cientific **S**oftware (FOSSS)

## STEAM

- **S** - Science
- **T** - Tecnology
- **E** - Engineering
- **A** - Art(s)
- **M** - Mathematics

## STEM(M)

Okaloosa County

- **S** - Science
- **T** - Tecnology
- **E** - Engineering
- **M** - Mathematics
- **M** - Medicine

## Geniuses

Characteristics

- Curious?

- Passionate?

- Range of interests?

## Geniuses

You don't have to be a genius to be a scientist, but I believe you do
have to have a curiosity and a passion for technical details in one or
more areas to be successful in STEAM fields.

My objective today is to expose you to some software that may be
useful in one or more of those fields.

- Perhaps you have a child or grandchild who might benefit from the
  information.

The beauty of the software is it is free, runs on a wide variety of
hardware, and thus has a low or no cost for those needing access to
it.

- Perhaps your civic club or church can use it for helping underserved
  children or adults.

## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

(Pay attention, there will be a quiz at the end!)

Following are some of the programs I have used for professional and
personal projects:

**Graphical**

- **Gimp** (replace **Photoshop** for bitmap images)

- **Inkscape** (replace **CorelDraw** for vector images)

**Office suites**

- **LibreOffice** (replace **MS Office**)

## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

**Typesetting**

- **LaTex**

**CAD**

- **BRL-CAD**

**Version control**

- **Git**
- **Subversion**
- **Bazaar**

## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

**Version control hosting and collaboration**

- **Github**
- **Bitbucket**
- **SourceForge**

**Text Editors**

- **Emacs**
- **Vi**
- **Gedit**

**Specialized Editors**

- **TexStudio** (for LaTeX and TeX-based languages)

## Free STEAM Programs (Apps)

Other programs:

**Mathematical programming**

- **SciLab** (replace **MatLab**)
- **Octave** (plotting and visualization)
- **Maxima** (symbolic mathematics)

**Publishing (page layout)**

- **Scribus** (replace **MS Publisher** or **Adobe PageMaker/InDesign**)

**Statistical programming**

- **R (R-base)** (replace **SAS** or **SPSS**)

And many others...

## Why do we recommend and use FOSS?

- Source is available for inspection

- Fixes are available from the community of developers

- Two major variants:

	- Free for non-commercial use

	- Free for any use

- Why do developers work on FOSS?

	- Fun, pride, self-interest, altruism, competition

	- Some are paid by companies with a vested interest in a
	  particular FOSS project

- Why do companies give it away?

	- Constrained by licensing

	- Sell support services

- Doesn't it seem like socialism?

## Publishing cycle

A technical student will have to deal with the publishing cycle:

- plan and execute programs or experiments

- collect data

- post-process data

- document results

Many of the programs introduced so far can be used for that cycle to
produce beautiful results, such as my thesis (available for
inspection) which used:

- **LaTeX**
- **Encapsulated PostScript**

Stay for the next session for more details.

## Summary

- Today we have looked at a few of the thousands of free programs
  available for Windows (and Mac and Linux).

- There is something out there for nearly any interest.  I encourage
  you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your knowledge and skills.
