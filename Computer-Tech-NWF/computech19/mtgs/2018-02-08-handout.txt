Computer Tech 2019 Planning Session
2018-02-08

Suggestions by Tom Browder, NWFLUG

1. Keep highlighting the https://computertechnwf.org website
   as the focus for advertising the upcoming presentations.
   There is a page now for the 2019 events.
   (Modify the name of the website?)

   a. have bios of all likely presenters

   b. nail down title and synopsis of sessions as early
      as possible
   
   c. get commitment from presenters early, and agreement
      to provide:
      
      (1) bio NOW
      (2) contact e-mail NOW
      (3) handouts and presentation materials after the
          expo (all in pdf format, file names with no
          spaces)

2. Try to have a practice session in the fall.

3. Instead of having 40+ different sessions, have
   multiple presentations of the same sessions.

4. Have our own mailing list.

5. List likely topics and have interested persons
   vote for ones they plan to attend.

6. Mail down and publicize the event early.
