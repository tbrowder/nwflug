## NPM

- **Niceville Perl Mongers (NPM)**

- <**<http://niceville.pm.org>**>

- The NPM group (in Niceville, Florida, USA) is a place for those
interested in the Perl programming languages.

- Meets third Monday of every month (by **appointment only** for now), 5:30 to
  7:30 (**Crosspoint UMC**).

- Purpose: meet others with similar interests, and teach and learn
about various aspects of the **Perl** programming languages (including the
new **Rakudo Perl 6**).

- **Perl** also powers the Internet (it was the first language used
  during the rapid onset of the Internet and still powers much of it
  behind the scenes today).
