## Exercise 1

Using the *gedit* editor (or the editor of your choice), write a
program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen (stdout) when
executed.  Save and name the source files "hello-world.\*" where '*'
is the conventional suffix (file extension) for the language.

Write it in one or more of the following languages:

- 1. **Perl6**
- 2. **Bash**
- 3. **Python**
- 4. **C**
- 5. **PostScript**

Note that the first three are commonly referred to as *scripting*
languages), *C* is a *compiled* language, and *PostScript* is a
*markup* language.


## Exercise 2

Using either the command line (which uses the bash shell by default)
or one of the languages above, determine how many files are known to
the system.

## Exercise 3

Using one of the scripting languages, write a script that will execute
the other programs (except the PostScript one).
