## My View as a Knowledge Worker

- It's more fun to produce digital products than use them.

- The PC is a producer's tool box.

- The iPad is for?

- All tasks can be seen as filtering and transforming data (in binary or text format).

- All tasks should be automated as much as possible.

## My View as a Knowledge Worker

- Interoperability between tools relies on knowing data formats for inputs and outputs.

- FOSS allows access to internals while proprietary tools usually don't.

- Proprietary tools tend to be more expensive as they become more complex and more useful.

- The public education system is Windows-centric to the detriment of some children.
