## AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS

**What do you expect from this presentation?**

## OBJECTIVE

My purpose is to give you more details on Linux
and how to get it.

I hope the parents and grandparents of children
interested in a technical career can benefit from
the information and pass that on.

## Linux: What is it?

GNU/Linux is a general name for an operating system (*OS*, sometime
written as *O/S*) with a Linux kernel plus a suite of GNU (Free Software
Foundation) software tools that, together, provide nearly the
equivalent of a POSIX-certified OS like UNIX, HPUX, or IRIX.

GNU/Linux OS's come in many complete forms, callled *distributions*
(or *distros*).  One of the most well-known distros is Ubuntu, which,
up until very recently, was used by Google, but they just announced
they were moving to *Debian*, my distro of choice for over 10 years.

Note that Microsoft now provides a version of Ubuntu as an add-on to
Windows 10.

My distro of choice is *Debian*, and an easier-to-use distro, with a
similar desktop, I recommend to new users is *Linux Mint*.
It's running on this laptop.

## Linux: Why should I care?

Linux drives a significant part of the Internet and the cloud.

Linux has a huge number of FOSS packages available to meet almost ever
need.

Pertinent attributes:

- Powerful operating system (O/S or OS) that can be used in place of
  Windows or Mac

- More usable command-line-interface (CLI) that permits complex pipeline tasks and
  GUI-less programming

- Especially valuable as a modern slide-rule or calculator for
  scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and analytical professionals
  in all fields

- Kitbashing (chaining tools)

- More control over your system

- Case-sensitive file systems

- Tool box atmosphere

- Multidisciplinary

## Linux: How do I get it?

You can get Ubuntu now with Windows 10 and that is probably the
easiest way to get familiar with it, but you'll eventually want a
native installation for more general-purpose use.

## Testing Linux distros (distributions)

Several methods

- VirtualBox

- Live CD/DVD

- Bootable USB drive

- Spare computer (native install; dual or single boot)

We'll use VirtualBox for this presentation

## The VirtualBox site

Note at the website the __Downloads__ and __End-user docs__ links and the __News Flash__ section

## After selecting "Downloads"

## Don't forget the "Extension Pack" (for USB 2/3)

The "Extension Pack" is not distributable

## Upgrading or installing

After downloading the main file, double-click on it and install it as
usual on Windows (or the equivalent on Mac).

When upgrading or installing, you lose network access temporarily.
You may have to uninstall an old version when upgrading.

## Selecting the Linux distro

Considerations (* recommended)

- amount of RAM (* 2 GB+)
- 32- or 64-bit (* 64-bit)
- 64-bit guest on 32-bit host? (NOT recommended)
- type network interface (remote access needed?)

## Installing the Linux guest...

We have a VM already prepared for you here through a link on the Computer Tech NWF home page:

- <**<https://computertechnwf.org/virtualbox-vm.html>**>

Download and import it

At 4+ Gb it will take a while to download!

## Importing the VM (1)

## Importing the VM (5)

Complete, now check settings

## Importing the VM (6)

## Now start the VM

## VM goodies

The VM has a few things added over the initial installation:

- a simple Emacs customization file (**~/.emacs.d/init.el**)

- Perl 6

## A very brief Linux tour (1)

- Using the VM (**demo**)

    - Terminal window

    - Package manager

    - Emacs

    - Perl 6

## Linux: How do I learn to use it?

A free online course is offered under the auspices of the Linux Foundation:

<**<https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-linux-linuxfoundationx-lfs101x-1>**>

My group, the NWFLUG, can provide assistance with installation and use.


<**<https://nwflug.org>**>

## SUMMARY


- Today we have taken a look at getting a usable Linux installation
  for learning.

- If you find Linux useful, consider joining our local Linux user
  group.

- There is something out there in Linux land for nearly any interest.
  I encourage you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your
  knowledge and skills.
