## Hypothesis

Young people interested in careers involved with science, mathematics,
engineering, or almost any technical field should be introduced to
**Linux**.

## What is Linux?

More formally known as **GNU/Linux**, it's a free operating system
(OS) invented by Linus Torvald to provide a UNIX-like system with all
the standard command-line and graphical tools that accompany such a
system.

**Linux**, rather than Windows or Mac, provides much of the
behind-the-scenes *cloud* computing in data centers and
high-performance computing facilities. It also powers the Android, the
Chromebook, and the *Internet of Things* (IoT).

## Why Linux?

The command-line environment provides the user with almost complete
freedom to automate tasks typical in research or other work or study
in technical fields.

**Linux** also gives the user much greater control over what happens
and what does not happen on his or her computer.

As a bonus, **Linux** comes packaged with thousands of free
applications in such categories as: games, office suites, publishing
and graphics, CAD, FEA, education, science, mathematics, music, art,
and many others.

## Linux vs. Windows: Windows

Windows:

- Is everywhere

- Is primarily a GUI operation

- Is expensive

- **Hides internals**

- **Has a non-case-sensitive file system**

- Updates when Microsoft says it should, often restarting your
  computer without your permission.

## Linux vs. Windows: Linux

Linux:

- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

- Is everywhere, although it is usually working behind the scenes

- Has both GUI and intrinsic command line interface (CLI) capabilities

- **Is FREE**

- Shows as much or as little of the internals as you want to see

- Has a case-sensitive file system

- **Performs upgrades only if you want it to**

- Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
  "programmable calculator"

## Linux: How to get it

On Windows or Mac:

+ Use a live, bootable USB [recommended for intro]

+ Use **Putty** on Windows or a terminal app on an iPad to connect to
  a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)

+ Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem

+ Use a live, bootable CD/DVD [only as a last resort]

## Linux: How to get it (cont.)

+ Install Linux as a VM guest on Windows 10 Pro Hyper-V

+ Install VirtualBox or VMwareto run a Linux Virtual Machine

On a Chromebook:

+ Use the Linux App

Best:

+ Use a dual-boot, native installation

+ Use a Chromebook

## Linux comes in many \"flavors\"

A Linux system comes packaged in many **distributions** (*distros*)
such as Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.

See <**<https://distrowatch.com>**> for lots of information about
popularity, download statistics, and other stats on hundreds of
**distros**.

We think *Linux Mint* is one of the best *distros* for beginners. I
prefer *Debian* and have used it for over ten years.

(Note that Google has moved to **Debian** from Ubuntu recently.)

## Linux and its FOSS apps in the work place

A common requirement for many work flows inludes:

+ data filtering...pipeline tools...
+ app chaining
+ glue languages
+ data formats in/out
+ data exchange

    + proprietary vs foss

All of those are much easier to deal with (in my opinion and
experience) in a Linux CLI environment.

## Sometimes Linux is the only answer

**Eukleides**: A geometry drawing tool

It is a FOSS app that is **NOT** available on Windows or Mac:

<**<http://www.eukleides.org/>**>

Would the students you know like that?

## Sometimes Linux is the only answer (cont.)

My slide generator runs on Linux, and consists of several major pieces:

+ **LaTex**  a markup language with typesetting sotware
+ **Beamer** a collection of LaTex code for slide making
+ **Perl 6** a computer programming language

I can fix errors almost on the fly. Seen any yet?

## Linux on-line server in the works

Keep an eye out for my upcoming publicly available cloud server to be
available at **Perl6.club**.

It will provide CLI access with a user name and password to be
provided upon request.

All you have to do is get access to a suitable secure shell (ssh)
terminal on your device such as:

+ **Putty** on Windows

+ **Termius** on an iPad

## Linux help?

There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources to be found
on the Internet.

My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG), meets
monthly, and we have an installation meeting (by appointment only) on
the third Monday of every month.

Check out our website at <**<https://nwflug.org>**>.

## Summary

- Today we have looked at the utility of Linux and the advantages it
  can provide in many domains.

- Stay for my next session to learn a bit about computer programming
  on a Linux host.
