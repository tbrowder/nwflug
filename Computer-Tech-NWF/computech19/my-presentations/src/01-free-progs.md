<!-- insert-file headers.md -->

## AUDIENCE EXPECTATIONS

**What do you expect from this presentation?**

## OBJECTIVE

My purpose is to give you an introduction to available Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) for ordinary users as well as scientists and
other technical persons, and I will demonstrate a program of
**IMMENSE** value to **YOU** as well as the FOSS community.

I hope the parents and grandparents of children interested in a
technical career can benefit from the information and pass that on.

## FOSS

- **F**ree and **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware (FOSS) for Windows, Mac, and Linux

## Selected FOSS programs (apps)

(Pay attention, there will be a quiz at the end!)

Following are some of the programs I have used for professional and
personal projects:

**Graphical**

- **Gimp** (replace **Photoshop** for bitmap images)

- **Inkscape** (replace **CorelDraw** for vector images)

**Office suites**

- **LibreOffice** (replace **MS Office**)

## Selected FOSS programs (cont.)

**Typesetting**

- **LaTex**

**CAD**

- **BRL-CAD**

**Version control**

- **Git**
- **Subversion**
- **Bazaar**

## Selected FOSS programs (cont.)

**Version control hosting and collaboration**

- **GitHub**
- **Bitbucket**
- **SourceForge**

## Selected FOSS programs (cont.)

Other programs:

**Mathematical programming**

- **SciLab** (replace **MatLab**)
- **Octave** (plotting and visualization)
- **Maxima** (symbolic mathematics)

**Publishing (page layout)**

- **Scribus** (replace **MS Publisher** or **Adobe PageMaker/InDesign**)

**Statistical programming**

- **R (R-base)** (replace **SAS** or **SPSS**)

And many others...

## Why do we recommend and use FOSS?

- Source is available for inspection

- Fixes are available from the community of developers

- Two major variants:

	- Free for non-commercial use

	- Free for any use

- Why do developers work on FOSS?

	- Fun, pride, self-interest, altruism, competition

	- Some are paid by companies with a vested interest in a
	  particular FOSS project

- Why do companies give it away?

	- Constrained by licensing

	- Sell support services

- Doesn't it seem like socialism?

## A Killer program for everyone!

**Git** ["Get IT"?]

We can use it for free version control on **Github.com** or **Bitbucket.org**!

Plus, we get free backups, too!

Requirements:

+ Git installed on your PC

+ A Github or Bitbucket account

## Git (cont.)

If you want to have a private backup, you'll have to use Bitbucket or
pay a small amount to Github.

Let's look at my Github account for illustration using the command line...

<**<https://github.com/tbrowder>**>

Many GUI clients are available. I use **SmartGit** from Syntevo:

<**<https://https://www.syntevo.com/>**>


## Summary

- Today we have looked at a few of the thousands of free programs
  available for Windows (and Mac and Linux).

- There is something out there for nearly any interest.  I encourage
  you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your knowledge and skills.

- Oh, and don't forget about version control!
