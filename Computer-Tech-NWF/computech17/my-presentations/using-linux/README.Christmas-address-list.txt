The Christmas address mailing list labels I can provide must be
created from the SQLite3 database table format as shown in the
following file:

  Christmas-addr-list.sqlite3

The file can be opened and modified as necessary by use of any SQLite3
database manager program.  The one I used on Windows is the free
SQLite Browser (also called DB Browser) available at:

  http://sqlitebrowser.org/

That database file, using SQLite Browser, was created by importing the
following file:

  Christmas-addr-list.sqlite3.csv

Use whichever format is easiest for you to add your own addresses.

The finished file (in either format) can then be sent to me to
generate the mailing label pages in PDF format as shown in class.

Those pages for the example format files above are to be found in this
directory:
