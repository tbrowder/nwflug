## Linux

Introduction to Linux

## What is Linux?

- Powerful, free operating system (O/S or OS) that can be used in place of
  Windows or Mac

- Usually packaged with thousands of free software packages to suit nearly every interest

- Note there are other free OSs

## Why use Linux?

- Command-line-interface (CLI) that permits complex pipeline tasks and
  GUI-less programming

- All aspects of the system are accessible to the user, including the source code

## Who uses Linux

- Cloud service providers

- Data warehouses

- Web servers

- High Performance Computing (HPC) facilities

- Especially valuable as a modern slide-rule or calculator for
  scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and analytical professionals
  in all fields

## Some terminology

- OS (or O/S): Operating System (the executive program and all its
  suppporting programs)

- FOSS: Free and Open Source Software

- GNU: "Gnu's Not Unix," a brand of the Free Software Foundation

- Linux: the name of the kernel (executive program)

- distro: a GNU/Linux distribution

- GUI: Graphical User Interface

- CLI: Command Line Interface

## GNU/Linux distributions (distros)

A distro is a collection of

- a Linux kernel (the executive program)

- hundreds of small utility CLI programs

- a subset of the thousands of free aplication programs ("apps")

## Which distro is for you?

- Hundreds are available

- <**<http://distrowatch.com>**> can help you decide

- one of the most popular is Ubuntu

- distros can be divided into groups by their package formats and management systems

    - Debian: 'deb' format, 'aptitude' package manager

    - Fedora: rpm format, 'yum' package manager

    - there are many others: ...

## Getting and testing Linux distros (distributions)

Several methods (next session)

- VirtualBox

- Live CD/DVD

- Bootable USB drive

- Spare computer (native install; dual or single boot)

## Becoming Familiar with FOSS

Become familiar with FOSS

- Motivation

- Resources

- Advantages

- Scope

- Sources

- Installation

- Cautions

## Kudos

Many people are responsible for our current technology, but these are
particularly noteworthy in the FOSS arena:

- Windows is not my OS of choice, but I thank **Bill Gates** for making
  the PC widely available

- For Linux and FOSS we need to thank:

	- **Richard Stallman** (originator of the Free Software
	  Foundation and much GNU software)

	- **Linus Torvalds** (originator of the Linux kernel)

## Why do we recommend and use FOSS?

- Source is available for inspection

- Fixes are available from the community of developers

- Two major variants:

	- Free for non-commercial use

	- Free for any use

- Why do developers work on FOSS?

	- Fun, pride, self-interest, altruism, competition

	- Some are paid by companies with a vested interest in a
	  particular FOSS project

- Why do companies give it away?

	- Constrained by licensing

	- Sell support services

- Doesn't it seem like socialism?

## Topics to be covered

- Internet considerations

- Downloading

- Authenticating

- Brief look at some free programs and resources

# Fundamentals

- A user should be familiar with getting around his or her computer and the
  Internet and with:

	- Files and directories (folders)

	- Searching (local and web)

	- Downloading and installing

	- Browsing

	- Getting help

	- Command line use (maybe)

## Internet considerations

- Like the Biblical Tree of Knowledge

	- Good

		- Infinite resources for good

	- Evil

		- Criminals, terrorists, and mischief makers abound

- You **must** be on the alert

## Security concerns

- Browser security

- Download authentication

- Encrypted communications (**https**) (BIG push on it now)

- DNS spoofing

	- **google.com** translates to an IP address by a DNS server

	- DNS servers can be hijacked

	- Familiar home pages can be hijacked

## Browser security

- Chrome (or Firefox)

	- **Lastpass** add-on (**<https://lastpass.com>**)

		- Strong passwords

		- Unique password for every site

- Use **https** where available

	- Provides encrypted communications between you and recipient

## Authentication

- Use check sums to check downloaded files

- Use public key encryption when appropriate

# Some brief looks

## Inkscape

Replacement for Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator or Adobe InDesign

Here is one of my drawings: a circuit diagram exported as a bitmap.

## Gimp

Replacement for Photoshop

I use all the time for preparing images for my websites.  I crop all
my images to a small square and then scale to 100x100 pixels to use as
thumb nails.

We look at one of my sites for an example (report 2014-08-23).

## GnuCash

Replacement for Quicken

I've used it for at least eight years now, and have never looked back to Quicken!

## LibreOffice

Replacement for Microsoft Office

- Not perfect, but improving all the time

## Summary

- Today we have looked at Linux and a few of the thousands of free programs
  available for Linux (and Windows and Mac).

- There is something out there for nearly any interest.  I encourage
  you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your knowledge and skills.
