Now using modules:

  Pod::S5
  Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate

which includes executable:

  pod2s5

Using a bash script to run it.

Making images 40px seems to be okay.  Need to allow for an image on
the right, but not yet available, so we use a raw html two-column
table.

From the pod2s5 man page:


  pod2s5 [-hv] [options] inputfile.pod
     --theme <theme>     the theme to use, default is 'default'. Available
                         themes: default, flower, i18n, pixel, yatil.

     --dest <directory>  target directory where to install the slideshow.
                         If not specified the target directory name will
                         be generated from the B<name> parameter or from
                         the filename of the source pod file.

     --author <author>   the name of the slideshow author.

     --creation <date>   when the slideshow were generated (default: current date).

     --company <org>     company or organisation (default: none).

     --where <location>  where the slideshow were made (default: hostname).

     --name <name>       the name of the slideshow (title).

  -v --version           print the current version of the program.

  -h --help              print usage information.

DESCRIPTION

       pod2s5 converts POD input to a S5 HTML slideshow. No additional
       software is required. Just write a POD file, run pod2s5 on it -
       and you're done.

POD
       Beside the known perlpod markup some additions have been made:

       Since we are generating a slideshow, the POD must be devided
       into pieces which can be used as slides. Slides will be
       separated by the =head1 title tag (which itself becomes the
       title of the slide.

        =head1 Intro --+
                       |
        [..]           +------- Slide 1
        [..]           |
                   ----+

        =head1 Intro --+
                       |
        [..]           +------- Slide 2
        [..]           |
                   ----+

        =head1 End   --+
                       |
        [..]           +------- Slide 3
        [..]           |
                   ----+

       Each slide may contain any valid POD.

       o   Images can be included using the tag G<image.png>.  You
           must manually copy images to the target directory.

       o   Plain HTML code can be included using the html formatter,
           eg:

            =begin html

            <title>Blah</title>

            =end html

       o   You can create incremental slides using bullet lists, that
           is each list item will appear separately, as if it were on
           an extra slide.

           Example:

            =over

            =item *

            1st item

            =item *

            2nd item

            =back

       o   You can add special formatters for code, which will be
           syntax highlighted if the module
           Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate is installed. Use the name
           of the programming language as the formatter name.

           Example:

            =begin perl

            if ($var) {
             exit;
            }

            =end perl

           To get a list of the available languages, refer to the Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate manpage.
