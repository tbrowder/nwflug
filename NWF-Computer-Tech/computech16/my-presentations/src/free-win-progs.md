## Objectives

Become familiar with FOSS

- Motivation

- Resources

- Advantages

- Scope

- Sources

- Installation

- Cautions

## Background

- I'm a recently-retired engineer with ManTech International
  Corporation (**<http://mantech.com>**)
  
- I've been using Unix/Linux and FOSS professionally for over 22 years

## Kudos

Many people are responsible for our current technology, but these are
particularly noteworthy in the FOSS arena:

- Windows is not my OS of choice, but I thank **Bill Gates** for making
  the PC widely available

- For Linux and FOSS we need to thank:

	- **Richard Stallman** (originator of the Free Software
	  Foundation and much GNU software)

	- **Linus Torvalds** (originator of the Linux kernel)

## Why do we recommend and use FOSS?

- Source is available for inspection

- Fixes are available from the community of developers

- Two major variants:

	- Free for non-commercial use

	- Free for any use

- Why do developers work on FOSS?

	- Fun, pride, self-interest, altruism, competition

	- Some are paid by companies with a vested interest in a
	  particular FOSS project

- Why do companies give it away?

	- Constrained by licensing
	
	- Sell support services

## Topics to be covered

- Windows versus Linux

- Internet considerations

- Downloading

- Authenticating

- Tour of free programs and resources

## Windows vs. Linux

- Windows:

	- Is everywhere

	- It's primarily a GUI operation

	- Expensive

	- Hides internals

- Linux:

	- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

	- Is unparalled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
	  programmable calculator

	- Is free

# Fundamentals

- I assume familiarity with getting around your computer and the
  internet and with:

	- Files and directories (folders)

	- Searching (local and web)

	- Downloading and installing

	- Browsing

	- Getting help

	- Command line use
	
## Internet considerations

- Like the Biblical Tree of Knowledge

	- Good

		- Infinite resources for good

	- Evil

		- Criminals, terrorists, and mischief makers abound

- You **must** be on the alert

## Security concerns

- Browser security

- Download authentication

- Encrypted communications (**https**)

- DNS spoofing

	- **google.com** translates to an IP address by a DNS server

	- DNS servers can be hijacked

	- Familiar home pages can be hijacked

## Browser security

- Chrome (or Firefox)

	- **Lastpass** add-on (**<https://lastpass.com>**)

		- Strong passwords

		- Unique password for every site

- Use **https** where available

	- Provides encrypted communications between you and recipient

## Authentication

- Use check sums to check downloaded files

	- Jacksum

- Use public key encryption when appropriate

	- GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)

## Preparation for using FOSS

- Install a zip program

- Install (if necessary) Windows Power Shell

- Install a check sums program

- Install a public key program

## Tour of free programs and resources

Use my free handout available online at **<https://computertechnwf.org>**.

# Some brief looks

## Summary

- Today we have looked at a few of the thousands of free programs
  available for Windows

- There is something out there for nearly any interest.  I encourage
  to venture forth, have fun, and expand your knowledge and skills.

- I am glad to help via e-mail (please mention Computer Tech 2016 in
  the subject):
