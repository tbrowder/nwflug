## Upgrading or installing

When upgrading or installing, you lose network access temporarily.
You may have to uninstall an old version when upgrading.


## Selecting the Linux distro

Considerations (* recommended)

- amount of RAM (* 2 GB+)
- 32- or 64-bit (* 64-bit)
- 64-bit guest on 32-bit host? (NOT recommended)
- type network interface (remote access needed?)

## Installing the Linux guest...
