## Introduction to Linux

- Using VirtualBox for Windows

- From the schedule:

    1. Demo install of **Oracle's Virtual Box**.
    2. Install a Virtual Machine Image of **Ubuntu**.
    3. Take tour of **Ubuntu**'s features.

## Testing Linux distros (distributions)

Several methods

- VirtualBox

- Live CD/DVD

- Bootable USB drive

- Spare computer (native install; dual or single boot)

We'll use VirtualBox for this presentation

## The VirtualBox site

Note at the website the __Downloads__ and __End-user docs__ links and the __News Flash__ section

## After selecting "Downloads"

## Don't forget the "Extension Pack" (for USB 2/3)

The "Extension Pack" is not distributable

## Upgrading or installing

After donwloading the main file, double-click on it and install it as
usual on Windows (or the equivalent on Mac).

When upgrading or installing, you lose network access temporarily.
You may have to uninstall an old version when upgrading.

## Selecting the Linux distro

Considerations (* recommended)

- amount of RAM (* 2 GB+)
- 32- or 64-bit (* 64-bit)
- 64-bit guest on 32-bit host? (NOT recommended)
- type network interface (remote access needed?)

## Installing the Linux guest...

We have a VM already prepared for you here through a link on the Computer Tech NWF home page:

- <**<https://computertechnwf.org/virtualbox-vm.html>**>

Download and import it

At 4+ Gb it will take a while to download!

## Importing the VM (1)

## A very brief Linux tour

- Using the VM (**demo**)

- Using my Debian 7 laptop (**demo**)


## Resources

- Free Linux tutorial (sponsored by the Linux Foundation
<**<http://www.linuxfoundation.org/>**>: go to
<**<https://www.edx.org/>**> and search for "LFS101x.2"

- Linux for Dummies (book)

- Linux Bible (**demo**)

- Our local Linux user group: <**<https://nwflug.org>**> meets once a month

## Summary

- Today we have taken a look at getting a usable Linux installation
  for learning.

- If you find Linux useful, consider joining our local Linux user group.

- There is something out there in Linux land for nearly any interest.
  I encourage you to venture forth, have fun, and expand your
  knowledge and skills.
