## Science Fair

Linux User Group Computer Science Award Winner

Niceville, Florida, February 19, 2016

The Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG) representative,
Mr. Rand Fernandez, presents the group's second annual Computer
Science award to Miss Jasmine Sumpter at the Robert Sheffield Science
and Engineering Fair awards ceremony held at St. Mary Catholic School,
FWB, on February 16th.  Miss Sumpter, a sophomore at the Seacoast
Collegiate High School in Walton County, won the award for her project
"Save Hubble 2.0."  The award includes a check for $100 and a handsome
certificate.  Miss Sumpter has been invited to a future meeting of the
NWFLUG to discuss her project.  Information on the NWFLUG can be found
on their website.

## Science Fair

Jasmine Sumpter was our award winner.  We have asked her to address
this group some time.  

John Fay and Rand Fernandez were very busy with judging multiple
awards besides ours!  As well, new member Dean Covey was also a judge
for another group.

- Note that I sent a press release to four outlets (Bay Beacon,
  Panhandle Focus, Walton Sun, and the NWF Daily News).  I have yet to
  see anything in any of them!

## Science Fair

We believe we should reconsider our award for next year.  

- Our award doesn't fit with the science fair model. 

- Ideas?


## Two interesting sites

- Linux From Scratch (LFS)

- Minix 3 OS

## Linux From Scratch

A great guide for the do-it-yourself person.

See the website at 

- <**<http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/>**>

In a similar vein, see my limited set of configuration scripts here (a
WIP)

## Minix 3 OS

- It was the model that Linus Torvalds used to create the Linux kernel.

- It has been updated and improved over the years and is compatible with NetBSD. 

- It currently runs on x86 and ARM CPUs.
