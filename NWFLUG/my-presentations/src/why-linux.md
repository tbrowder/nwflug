title: Why Linux?

## Hypothesis

Young people interested in careers involved with
science, mathematics, engineering, or almost any technical
field should be introduced to **Linux**.

## What is Linux?

More formally known as  **GNU/Linux**,
it's a free system (OS) invented by Linus Torvald to
provide a UNIX-like system with all the standard
command-line and graphical tools that accompany
such a system.

It, rather than Windows or Mac, provides much of the behind-the-scenes
*cloud* computing in data centers and high-performance computing
facilities.

## Why Linux?

The command-line environment provides the user with almost complete
freedom to automate tasks typical in research or other work or study
in technical fields.

## Linux vs. Windows: Windows

Windows:

- Is everywhere

- It's primarily a GUI operation

- Expensive

- **Hides internals**

- **Non-case-sensitive file system**

## Linux vs. Windows: linux

Linux:

- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

- Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
  "programmable calculator"

- **Is free**

- **Upgrades are done ONLY if you want to!**

## Linux: How to get it

On Windows or Mac:

+ Use **Putty** to connect to a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)

+ Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem

+ Install VirtualBox to run a Linux Virtual Machine

+ Use a dual-boot native installation

## Linux comes in many "flavors"

A Linux system comes packaged in many **distributions** such as
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.

See <**<https://distrowatch.com>**> for lots of information about
popularity, download statistics, and other stats on hundreds of
**distros**.

We think *Linux Mint* is one of the best *distros* for beginners. I
prefer *Debian* and have used it for over ten years

## Linux help?

There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources to be found
on the Internet.

My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG), meets
monthly, and we have an installation meeting (by appointment only) on
the third Monday of every month.
