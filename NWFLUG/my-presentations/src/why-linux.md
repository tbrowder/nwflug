title: Why Linux?

## Hypothesis

Young people interested in careers involved with science, mathematics,
engineering, or almost any technical field should be introduced to
**Linux**.

## What is Linux?

More formally known as  **GNU/Linux**,
it's a free operating system (OS) invented by Linus Torvald to
provide a UNIX-like system with all the standard
command-line and graphical tools that accompany
such a system.

**Linux**, rather than Windows or Mac, provides much of the behind-the-scenes
*cloud* computing in data centers and high-performance computing
facilities. It also powers the Android and the *Internet of Things* (IoT).

## Why Linux?

The command-line environment provides the user with almost complete
freedom to automate tasks typical in research or other work or study
in technical fields.

**Linux** also gives the user much greater control over what happens
and what does not happen on his or her computer.

As a bonus, **Linux** comes packaged with thousands of free
applications in categories of games, office suites, publishing and
graphics, CAD, FEA, educational, scientific, mathematical, musical,
and many others.

## Linux vs. Windows: Windows

Windows:

- Is everywhere

- Is primarily a GUI operation

- Is expensive

- **Hides internals**

- **Has a non-case-sensitive file system**

- Updates when Microsoft says it should, often restarting your
  computer without your permission.


## Linux vs. Windows: Linux

Linux:

- Is pretty much the opposite of Windows in most respects

- Is everywhere, although it is usually working behind the scenes

- Has both GUI and intrinsic command line capabilities

- **Is FREE**

- Shows as much or as little of the internals as you want to see

- Has a case-sensitive file system

- **Performs upgrades only if you want it to**

- Is unparalleled for the scientist or engineers: a powerful,
  "programmable calculator"

## Linux: How to get it

On Windows or Mac:

+ Use **Putty** to connect to a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)

+ Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem

+ Use a live, bootable USB [recommended for intro]

+ Use a live, bootable CD/DVD [only as a last resort]

## Linux: How to get it (cont.)

+ Install Linux as a VM guest on Windows 10 Pro Hyper-V

+ Install VirtualBox or VMwareto run a Linux Virtual Machine

Best:

+ Use a dual-boot, native installation

+ Use Hyper-V on Windows 10 Pro

+ Use a dedicated GNU/Linux PC or laptop

## Linux comes in many "flavors"

A Linux system comes packaged in many **distributions** such as
Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.

See <**<https://distrowatch.com>**> for lots of information about
popularity, download statistics, and other stats on hundreds of
**distros**.

We think *Linux Mint* is one of the best *distros* for beginners. I
prefer *Debian* and have used it for over ten years

## Linux help?

There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources to be found
on the Internet.

My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG), meets
monthly, and we have an installation meeting (by appointment only) on
the third Monday of every month.
