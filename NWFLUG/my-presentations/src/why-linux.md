title: Why Linux? 
<!-- insert-file headers.md -->

## Hypothesis

People interested in careers involved with
science, mathematics, engineering, or almost any technical
field should be introduced to **Linux**.

## What is Linux?

More formally known as  **GNU/Linux**,
it's a free system (OS) invented by Linus Torvald to
provide a UNIX-like system with all the standard
command-line and graphical tools that accompany
such a system.

## Why Linux?

The command-line environment provides the user
with almost complete freedom to automate tasks
typical in research or other work or study in 
technical fields.

## Linux: How to get it

On Windows or Mac:

+ Use **Putty** to connect to a cloud server (as cheap as $2.50 per month)

+ Install the Windows 10 Ubuntu subsystem

+ Install VirtualBox to run a Linux Virtual Machine

+ Use a dual-boot native installation

## Linux comes in many "flavors"

A Linux system comes packaged in many 
**distributions** such as Debian, Ubuntu,
Linux Mint, and others.

See <**<https://distrowatch.com>**> for lots
of information about popularity, download
statistics, and other stats on hundresds
of **distros**. 

## Linux help?

There is practically an infinite amount of Linux resources 
to be found on the Internet.

My group, the Northwest Florida Linux User Group (NWFLUG),
meets monthly, and we have an installation meeting,
by appointment only, on the third Monday of every
monthg.
