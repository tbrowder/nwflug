## March meeting

- Did anyone come?

- Did anyone take attendence?

## Meeting date/time change?

- How about 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM (or 8:00 PM)?

    - Working folks can get here easier.

- How about meeting quarterly?

    - Jibes better with proposal for a new NWFLUG project.

## New NWFLUG project proposal

- Rand and I, and we in previous meetings, have been kicking around
  about what to do.

- Note we still have $111.00 collected--trying to spend it--I suggest
  we just give it to Computer Tech for next year's event, or use it
  for expenses in a new project.

- New project proposal: community outreach via various means:

    - Public demos

	- Speakers bureau
