title: Creating a Bootable USB

## Objectives

+ Create a bootable USB with a persistent file system
+ Duplicate the USB

## Resources used

An iso file with a suitable live distribution:

+ debian-live-9.3.0-amd64-mate+nonfree.iso (NOT persistent)
+ ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso (PERSISTENT)

A 32 Gb USB 3.0 flash drive formatted with the FAT32 file system.

A Windows 10 computer running the Universal USB Installer (UUI) program:

## Results

It took about seven minutes on my new Win 10 computer.

+ Note that currently the Ubuntu distro can have a persistent file system, but the Debian cannot.

You can duplicate (image or clone) the new boot USB on other USBs (of equal or greater
size) with this free Windows product:

## Other methods

One can also use a Linux host to do similar USB boot generation, but
it is more involved and more dangerous at the moment.

On my TODO list is to write a Perl 6 program to create a bootable and
persistent USB for Debian (and possibly for FreeBSD).
