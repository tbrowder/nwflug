## Library Project

I have either heard nothing from my contacts or have received "no
thanks" from others.

I did get an invitation to talk to the Shalimar Library (a private one
not alliliated with the county coop), but their policies make such a
proposal unusable. However, they are very open to scheduling an "Intro
to Linux" talk sometime in 2018.

We have discussed such before and I'm working on my old "Intro to
Linux" talk to try to better tailor it to our desired audience:

- [grand]parents of children interested in STEMM (PTA/PTO)

- children interested in STEMM

- Computer Tech 2018

## Linux Demo

We have talked often about using a Rasperry Pi for Linux.  Ellis sent
me a link about some ideas:

Shall we use our money ($111) for a working demo?
