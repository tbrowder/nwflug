## Agenda

- Welcome

- Science Fair and our award

- Two interesting sites (Tom)

- Other items?

- Next meeting

## Welcome

- I had two guys, Jack Burk and his friend, Skip Sheldon for the
  Linux install night.  Skip was one of the first to contact me after
  the intial announcement of the NWFLUG!

## Science Fair

Jasmine Sumpter was our award winner.  We have asked her to address
this group some time.

- Note that I sent a press release to four outlets (Bay Beacon,
  Panhandle Focus, Walton Sun, and the NWF Daily News).  I have yet to
  see anything in any of them!
 
John Fay and Rand Fernandez were very busy with multiple awards besides ours!

We believe we should reconsider our award for next year.  

- Our award doesn't fit with the science fair model. 

- Ideas?


## Two interesting sites

- Linux From Scratch (LFS)

- Minix 3 OS

## Linux From Scratch

A great guide for the do-it-yourself person.

See the website at 

- <**<http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/>**>

In a similar vein, see my limited set of configuration scripts here (a
WIP)

## Minix 3 OS

- It was the model that Linus Torvalds used to create the Linux kernel.

- It has been updated and improved over the years and is compatible with NetBSD. 

- It currently runs on x86 and ARM CPUs.
