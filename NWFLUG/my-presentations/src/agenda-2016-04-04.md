## Welcome

- Jesus Fuentes e-mailed me about attending. He is a Computer
  Engineering student at UWF. He was one of the few attendees at my
  Perl 6 presentation at Computer Tech 2016.

## Website reminder

- The NWFLUG site:

    <**<https://nwflug.org>**>

- The NWFLUG on Github:

    <**<https://github.com/tbrowder/nwflug/tree/master/NWFLUG>**>


## Science Fair or Robotics

We believe we should reconsider our award for next year.  

- Our award doesn't fit with the science fair model. 

- A consensus is leaning toward the local Robotics competitions.

- Some handouts and a pass-around:

    - Robotics Competition Award: draft e-mail sent to everyone for
      comment (and I have some follow-on e-mail with Rand to mention)

    - Upcoming Robotics Events: copy of e-mail set to John Fay
      outlining events and volunteer opportunities (I probably should
      have forwarded the e-mail to all, but I thought we should see
      more about the situation first)

    - Copy of the ORBIT 2016 Rulebook (available on the git site; a pass-around)

## Some new experiences (Tom)

- Upgraded three servers to Debian 8

- Used the Mate desktop (love it!)

- The two remote upgrades went well

- The laptop upgrade failed, had to re-install!

- Discovered the CD/DVD with the non-free packages which were a
  life-saver for the internet devices on the laptop:

    <**<http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/>**>

    (Note the link is not easy to find when you start at <**<http://debian.org/>**>.)

- Had a ssh problem with all upgraded servers and discovered this
  handy site which enabled me to find the solution:

## Other items?

Anyone?

The next meeting will be on Monday, 2 May.

I will be away then.  Any volunteer to run the meeting, take
attendance, and take notes?

Any volunteers for presentations?
