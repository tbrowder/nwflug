## Proposed Community Project

We have discussed such before and I'm working on my old "Intro to
Linux" talk to try to better tailor it to our desired audience:

- Computer Tech 2018 [DONE, in a broader format]

- children interested in STEMM [no progress with the public school or library system]

- [grand]parents of children interested in STEMM (PTAs/PTOs, community service clubs, etc.)

The last group is what I want to target via talks at their meetings.

Here is another draft adding Hyper-V. [break]
