The files in this directory should be renamed to show the date the information is planned to be sent to the Bay Beacon (and other media outlets).

For example, a NWFLUG meeting is scheduled for the first Monday in November, 2017.  The calendar shows the date is 6 November.

The desired publication date for the Bay Beacn is the previous Wednesday which is 1 November (5 days prior to the meeting).

The date that the info should be sent is the Monday the week before the desired publication date, and that date is 23 October (14 days prior to the meeting).

Thus all files should have "2017-10-23" in their name.

Note the member data have been moved to a private repo.
